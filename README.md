## Introduction
The **Fingerprint Recognition System** is a biometric identification method that identifies individuals based on unique patterns present in their fingerprints. In this project, we use two approaches:
- **SIFT (Scale-Invariant Feature Transform)**: A traditional feature-based method to identify and match key points.
- **ResNet (Residual Neural Network)**: A deep learning model that extracts and learns fingerprint features for higher accuracy.

This system aims to offer a robust and efficient solution for fingerprint authentication tasks.

## Technologies Used
The following technologies and tools were utilized in this project:
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: OpenCV, TensorFlow, PyTorch, NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib
- **Deep Learning Frameworks**: TensorFlow, PyTorch
- **Algorithms**: SIFT and ResNet

## Programming Language
This project is developed entirely using **Python**.

## Model Details
### SIFT (Scale-Invariant Feature Transform)
- SIFT is a computer vision algorithm that detects and describes local features in images.
  
### ResNet (Deep Learning Model)
- ResNet is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture that effectively handles deep learning tasks by using skip connections.

## Results and Comparison
A detailed comparison of the accuracy, precision, and recall metrics between the SIFT and ResNet models is provided in the project.
